Hello! I am a Kenyan researcher based in South Korea. I am currently a PhD student at ** National Korea Maritime and Ocean University**, focusing on how Artificial Intelligence can improve maritime sustainability and security. 

On this site, I share summaries of my research, technical projects from my GitHub, and insights into my journey as a researcher in the maritime field.
